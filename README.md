# ASM-number-guesser
Here I wrote a 32-bit assembly number guesser program. You must add a script asm32 which will assemble it correctly.

Here’s a couple of sample transcripts:

Enter range, low to high: 1 100
Think of an integer between 1 and 100!
Is your number Less than, Equal to, or Greater than 50 (l,e,g)? g
Is your number Less than, Equal to, or Greater than 75 (l,e,g)? g
Is your number Less than, Equal to, or Greater than 88 (l,e,g)? l
Is your number Less than, Equal to, or Greater than 81 (l,e,g)? l
Is your number Less than, Equal to, or Greater than 78 (l,e,g)? e
I guessed it!

Here I think of a number that isn’t an integer:

Enter range, low to high: 1 100
Think of an integer between 1 and 100!
Is your number Less than, Equal to, or Greater than 50 (l,e,g)? l
Is your number Less than, Equal to, or Greater than 25 (l,e,g)? b
Is your number Less than, Equal to, or Greater than 25 (l,e,g)? g
Is your number Less than, Equal to, or Greater than 37 (l,e,g)? l
Is your number Less than, Equal to, or Greater than 31 (l,e,g)? g
Is your number Less than, Equal to, or Greater than 34 (l,e,g)? l
Is your number Less than, Equal to, or Greater than 32 (l,e,g)? g
Is your number Less than, Equal to, or Greater than 33 (l,e,g)? l
You must be cheating!
